# üß† Image Segmentation Learning Plan (PhD-Level)
_2-month full roadmap for deep learning and research-based interviews_

---

## üéØ Goal
- Understand image segmentation deeply (semantic, instance, panoptic)
- Build 2‚Äì3 strong projects
- Read and implement research papers
- Prepare for research-oriented interviews

## ‚úÖ Weekly Tracker

### Week 1: Classical Segmentation
- [ ] Read about thresholding, edge detection (Canny, Sobel)
- [ ] Implement Watershed and GrabCut (OpenCV)
- [ ] Try SLIC Superpixels
- [ ] Notes on region growing and classical pipelines

### Week 2: Deep Learning Foundations
- [ ] Understand FCN, U-Net (Encoder-Decoder)
- [ ] Implement U-Net in PyTorch
- [ ] Learn loss functions: CE, Dice, Focal
- [ ] Evaluate on Carvana or ISIC dataset

### Week 3: Architectures
- [ ] Study DeepLabV3(+), ASPP, PSPNet
- [ ] Implement or fine-tune DeepLabV3+ using torchvision
- [ ] Try instance segmentation with Mask R-CNN

### Week 4: Optimization & Training
- [ ] Learn Albumentations and augment pipeline
- [ ] Study CRF, class imbalance handling
- [ ] Implement CRF postprocessing
- [ ] Try experiment tracking with `wandb` or `mlflow`

### Week 5: Research Papers
- [ ] Read Segment Anything (SAM)
- [ ] Read SegFormer
- [ ] Read Mask2Former or Swin-Unet
- [ ] Implement or reproduce one paper result

### Week 6‚Äì8: Project + Interview Prep
- [ ] Build final segmentation project
- [ ] Write project documentation
- [ ] Prepare answers to common interview Qs
- [ ] Read one extra paper (bonus)
